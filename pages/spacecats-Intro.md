It all started with this:

[Alien Invasion](http://cykod.github.io/AlienInvasion/)



That is the intro project to [Professional HTML5 Mobile Game Development](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Professional-HTML5-Mobile-Game-Development.productCd-1118301323.html). One of the things I love most about this book: the very first thing you do is make a game. It happens so fast.

I decided to use the example as a rough blueprint. I'd add features and flesh out into a full game. 

Some libraries I found helpful:
  * [tiny-canvas](https://github.com/bitnenfer/tiny-canvas) for a lightweight wrapper around webGL.
  * [bulletmljs](https://github.com/daishihmr/bulletml.js) to create bullet patterns

I didn't find a great OOTB tool for touch controls that did exactly what I needed so I ended up making my own. I want to talk about that more but that will need to be its own post.

todo:
  * scoring
  * menu system
  * bosses
  * enemy movement
  * enhance levels
  * new weapons
