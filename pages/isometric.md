Been a while, howyabin?

So I was working on some isometric basics before I started my current job. The goal was to create a basic isometric tiling engine with collision detection and simple physics. Before you get excited I didn't even come close.

But I did make a few nice looking animations. I wish I could talk more about how this was made, but I honestly don't recall. It was like 6 months ago.

So, perhaps I'm not going quite so hard on the Game Development thing these days. I got [Space Cats](#spacecats_intro) to a level of sophistication I was happy with. I think the most important thing I learned was how to take criticism and not take it so personally when [idiot users](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/redundant) can't figure out your software. As a side note, literally all of my friends' ideas for my game were terrible. What I was most proud of was the hit detection, the use of WebGL for hardware acceleration, aaaaand the modifications to BulletML to allow variable timestep (sexy, sexy slow motion).

But seriously, I needed to be in a position where people tell me my code sucks. If I don't know what I'm doing wrong I can't get better. That's one of the (many) things I love about my new job. They do code review and my coworkers are really good about constructive criticism. My coworker MT said it best, "we're here to become better developers."
